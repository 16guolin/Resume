# html-resume

Single-page resume template built using HTML, CSS, and JS that can be viewed on the web or exported to a PDF.


## Flexibility

This template can be editted both in HTML and CSS. You can fully customize the layout and style to suit your needs.

## TODO

- Add feedback when page is saved (or an error occurs)
- Allow custom file names for saved HTML

## Compatibility

Tested on Chrome (67) and Firefox (61).
This software uses `localStorage`, `template`, flexbox, and custom properties and is intended for modern browsers.

This application does not communicate or sync with a server, and all data is saved locally.
It may not be able to save if `localStorage` is disabled for any reason.
